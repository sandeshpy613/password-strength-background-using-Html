Creating a Password Strength Checker Project 

## Introduction

Welcome to the Password Strength Checker project! This project is designed to help you assess the strength of passwords, ensuring that they meet security standards. This README file will provide you with an overview of the project and its functionality.

### Project Overview

In today's digital world, password security is of utmost importance. Weak passwords can lead to security breaches, data leaks, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. To combat these risks, it's essential to have a tool that can evaluate the strength of passwords and encourage users to create strong, secure passwords.

The Password Strength Checker project aims to address this issue by providing a tool that:

1. **Checks Password Strength**: The project can analyze a given password and determine its strength based on various criteria, such as length, character variety, and the absence of common patterns.

2. **Provides Feedback**: Users will receive feedback on the strength of their password, including suggestions for improvement.

3. **Promotes Secure Passwords**: By educating users about password strength and security best practices, the project encourages them to create strong passwords.

4. **Helps Protect Accounts**: Strong passwords are a crucial defense against unauthorized access. This project helps users protect their online accounts and personal data.

### How to Use the Password Strength Checker

1. **Input Password**: Users can input a password they want to evaluate for strength.

2. **Run the Checker**: The project will analyze the provided password and calculate its strength.

3. **Receive Feedback**: Users will receive feedback on the password's strength, such as "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong." Additionally, they will receive suggestions for improving the password if necessary.

4. **Take Action**: Users can then decide whether to use the password as is or make improvements based on the feedback provided.

### Technologies Used
